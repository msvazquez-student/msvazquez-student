## About Me

Hello! My name is Mateo Vazquez! I'm a 22-year old undergraduate student at the University of California: Santa Barbara (UCSB) pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in statistics and data science. I am currently residing in Santa Barbara, California and I am about to wrap up my bachelors by June 2022! My goal upon graduation is to obtain more experience through jobs and internships in data science related careers, specifically as a data scientist.

I have completed a few projects dedicated to my major such as constructing a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model and a decision tree regressor in order to predict future COVID-19 cases in California counties using times series data, conducting exploratory data analysis on the 2016 presidential elections with principal components analysis (PCA) and training a decision tree model to accurately predict which candidate a US county would choose based on their demographics, and finally training a linear regression model to predict the body masses of penguins on the Dream Island, Antarctica. I am currently involved in a personal project based on the tactical dual card-game Summoner Wars where me and my team are aiming to predict whether a player will win a game based on the past moves from prior turns. 

If you're interested in hiring me or collaborate on any projects, shoot me an email and I will respond at my earliest convenience!
